# Archiprod

This project was created to online shopping.

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1. Node version 16.13.0.

## How to install

Run `ng version` and `npm -v` to see your versions of Angular and Node. 
You need versions:
Angular CLI: 15.2.1
Node: 16.13.0 to work.

To switch in right node version, I recommend to download Node Version Manager.
Steps to change Node version by Node Version Manager:
1. Open Terminal as administrator.
2. To install Node version 16.10.0 run `nvm install 16.13.0`.
3. To see all available Node versions run `nvm list`.
4. To set needed Node version run `nvm use 16.13.0`.

In other case, you need to uninstall your Node and install Node 16.10.0.

To install Angular run `npm install -g @angular/cli@15.2.1`
If you have other installed Angular version you need to unistall it:
1. To uninstall Angular run `npm unistall -g @angular/cli`.
2. Run `npm cache clean --force`.
3. To install needed Angular version run `npm install -g @angular/cli@15.2.1`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Backend server

Run `npm run start-server` for a backend server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g c component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng g directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
